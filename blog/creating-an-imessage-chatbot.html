<p>During my internship with <a href="https://crowdstrike.com">CrowdStrike</a> last summer, I was introduced to <a href="https://hubot.github.com/">Hubot</a>. Hubot is fun, in on all of the jokes, and exceedingly helpful. Between the automation of menial tasks and joke/novelty functions, our office chatbot was a mainstay in most threads of import.</p>
<p>Seeing an opportutnity for a <em>lot</em> of novelty and a little automation, I desperately wanted my own personal chatbot - but I did not belong to any personal slacks or hipchats to put one in. The only messaging service I used on a regular basis was texting, so I set about constructing a framework for reading and writing iMessages.</p>
<h3>Reading Messages</h3>
<p>A chatbot must be able to listen for incoming messages process them. Since apple <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28399777/read-sms-using-swift">does not allow iOS apps to access messages stored on an iPhone</a>, the easiest way to field messages was to read the synced messages stored on my computer.</p>
<p>If you have iMessages synced to your Mac, all of the messages are stored in a SQLite database located at <code>~/Library/Messages/chat.db</code></p>
<p>There is some work that has already been done with regards to reverse engineering the database structure and reading messages. The most helpful resource I found was <a href="https://github.com/mattrajca/pymessage-lite">pymessage-lite</a>, which laid out the database structure*:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">_SqliteDatabaseProperties  deleted_messages         
attachment                 handle                   
chat                       message                  
chat_handle_join           message_attachment_join  
chat_message_join
</code></pre>
<p>The contents of these tables should be fairly self-explanatory.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>attachment</code> keeps track of any attachments (files, images, audio clips) sent or received, including paths to where they are stored locally as well as their file format.</li>
<li><code>handle</code> keeps track of all known recipients (people with whom you previously exchanged iMessages).</li>
<li><code>chat</code> keeps track of your conversation threads.</li>
<li><code>message</code> keeps track of all messages along with their text contents, date, and the ID of the recipient.</li>
</ul>

<p>To read messages and respond to them, the pertinent information is the <strong>contents</strong> of the message, stored in <code>message</code>, and which <strong>conversation</strong> it came from, which is stored in <code>chat</code>. The two are linked by <code>chat_handle_join</code>.</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/watchdog/">watchdog</a> to monitor the database for file changes (new messages) and the <code>sqlite3</code> python package to get the contents the new messages. Here is an excerpt from my iMessage processing library:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">LAST_READ = -1

# Fetches all messages exchanged with a given recipient.
def get_last_message():
	global LAST_READ                # highest index message that has been read

	connection = _new_connection()  # sqlite3 connection
	c = connection.cursor()         # sqlite3 cursor
	text = ''
	row_id = ''
	date = ''
	if LAST_READ == -1:             # if chatbot just booted, set to current max
		c.execute(&quot;SELECT * FROM message WHERE ROWID = (SELECT MAX(ROWID) FROM message)&quot;)
	else:                           # otherwise get all new messages
		c.execute(&quot;SELECT * FROM message WHERE ROWID &gt; &quot; + str(LAST_READ))

	messages = []
	for row in c:
		row_id = row[0]
		text = row[2]
		if text is None:
			continue                # ignore empty messages like images

		date = datetime.datetime.now()
		encoded_text = text.encode('ascii', 'ignore')
		message = Message(encoded_text, date) # Message datastructure to keep time and message
		guid = id_to_guid(row_id)   # id_to_guid(row_id) is a similar method using
		LAST_READ = row_id          # `chat_message_join` to retrieve the number from `chat
		messages.append([message, guid])

	return(messages)


	connection.close()

<p>Once all of the messages are in a neat array, a chatbot can use any number of language processing tools to consume commands and run the appropriate python code. <em>But</em>, how does it respond to those commands in iMessage?</p>
<h3>Sending Messages</h3>
<p>There is no iMessage api to send messages through python, nor is there one for any language except for applescript. Thankfully, there is a commandline tool, <a href="https://ss64.com/osx/osascript.html">osacscript</a>, which allows users to write and run arbitrary applescript commands. I used the <code>os</code> package in python to pipe the command into bash to run it. I based my command off of <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44852939/send-imessage-to-group-chat">this stackoverflow question</a>, since it was the only command I could find which allowed sending messages to named groups.</p>
<p>Implementation:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">#takes a message to send(string) and an imessage chat id to send it to(guid)
def send_message(self, string, guid):
        string = string.replace(&quot;'&quot;, &quot;&quot;)        #remove quotes in message due to
        string = string.replace('&quot;', '')        #inability to escape them in command.    

        body = &quot;&quot;&quot;
            osascript -e 'tell application &quot;Messages&quot;
              set myid to &quot;%s&quot;
              set mymessage to &quot;%s&quot;
              set theBuddy to a reference to text chat id myid
              send mymessage to theBuddy
            end tell' &quot;&quot;&quot; % (guid, string)
        print(body)
        os.system(body)
</code></pre>
<p>And there you have it! Between reading and sending iMessages, a chatbot can now be created!</p>
