<h1>About</h1>
<p><img src="me.jpeg" alt="Me" /></p>
<p>My name is Dan and I like computers. I am a software developer and reverse engineer, and I like to poke around at video games during my free time.</p>
<p>When not at my desk I am usually taking a leisurely stroll with a friend or podcast.</p>
<p>I spend a lot of time collecting songs that I <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2lUlj6v5jLZbZH445sVQ1E?si=fa9cbd9186b244be">like to live to</a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1jwv5F1BttjtnspQjZtYZz?si=723e33487db249e3">like to dance to</a>.</p>
<p>I love the ocean and the self-reliant, tight-knit communities of sail boats. I crewed on a Pacific crossing in the spring of 2022 from Panama to French Polynesia. The picture above is of me testing out the strength of a rope I spliced.</p>
<p>I have a strong interest in community living and cohousing.</p>
<p>I am in love.</p>
<p>I am fascinated by games that blend the real, the virtual, and the imaginary. Some examples are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_reality_game">ARGs</a>, and meta-narratives that grow from system-driven games like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090208102142/http://www.shacknews.com/featuredarticle.x?id=527">Eve: Online</a> or <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Xcom/comments/3f0jox/who_was_your_favourite_soldier_and_why/">XCOM</a> or even <a href="https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t">specific game servers</a>.</p>
<p>I grew up in the south, was educated in the midwest, lived and worked on the east coast, and have settled on the west one.</p>
<p>My favorite bands of all time are The Avalanches and Phoenix.</p>
<p>My favorite food is raw fish (and oysters).</p>
<p>I was blessed with loving family and friends, and I'm overall having a good time.</p>
